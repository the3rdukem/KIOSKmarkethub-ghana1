INVESTIGATE AND REPORT: THIS IS MY REPORT AFTER TESTING THE REPORTED IMPLEMENTATIONS BY AGENT. Investigate and report. DO NOT CHANGE ANY CODE, DO NOT FIX ANYTHING. INVESTIGATE AND REPORT ONLY

Messaging:

The messaging POPOVER now says Message Vendor. It should say Message “STORE NAME”


Aside the problems I mentioned above, messages seem to deliver fine between buyer and vendor. 

IMPROVEMENTS:

Attach photo icon triggers actions and sends photo but only sends a link “📷 Image: 5dd70284fd9db2267c19edfc.webp
/uploads/messages/messages_1768660147834_13d4b01b.webp” instead of the photo 

When a buyer clicks contact from a product page, the message should reference the product so the vendor can know which product the buyer is inquiring about.  DOES NOT WORK

The Store name at the top of messaging should link to the store page and buyer page. Clicking leads to a 404 page, but it worked with a different chat

Vendor should be able to send a product link directly in messaging.  NOT working. Vendor should have a share product button that will load vendors live products to choose from to send to buyer.

NOTIFICATIONS:

I created a number of actions from buyer: message from product page, message from store page, place an order and the vendor didn’t get any notifications or bell icon count. I fulfilled order from vendor end and the buyer didn’t get any notifications. STILL DOES WORK. The bell icon doesn’t give any new badges nor does it show old notifications

* Admin API endpoints:
    * GET/POST /api/admin/email/config - Configure email provider
    * GET /api/admin/email/health - Check provider status
    * GET/POST /api/admin/email/templates - Manage email templates
I CAN NOT find any of these in the admin portal: There is no Email provider API management in Admin API management. 

I CAN NOT find where to manage email templates in ADMIN portal

FIX ALL THE ABOVE PROBLEMS, STRICT NO REGRESSION REULES APPLY. DO NOT BREAK ANYTHING WHILE TRYING TO FIX. 

There is no need for a vendor dropdown field on the messaging POPOVER, it should only show the vendor the buyer wants to message.
