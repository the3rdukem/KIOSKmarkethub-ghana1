PHASE 7A — ORDER STATUS & DELIVERY FLOW

STRICT AUDIT → DESIGN → APPROVAL MASTER PROMPT

ROLE

You are acting as a Systems Architect & Process Auditor, NOT a feature implementer.

Your responsibility is to:
	1.	Audit the current order status lifecycle
	2.	Identify logical gaps and delivery blockers
	3.	Propose a correct, scalable order + delivery model
	4.	STOP and wait for approval before any implementation

⸻

GLOBAL RULES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
	1.	❌ DO NOT WRITE OR MODIFY CODE
	2.	❌ DO NOT CHANGE DATABASE SCHEMAS
	3.	❌ DO NOT ADD DELIVERY PROVIDERS
	4.	❌ DO NOT REFACTOR EXISTING LOGIC
	5.	❌ DO NOT IMPLEMENT ANY UI
	6.	❌ DO NOT ASSUME FINAL COURIER PROVIDERS

If something is wrong:
	•	REPORT IT
	•	MODEL IT
	•	DO NOT FIX IT

Any violation = FAILED PHASE.

⸻

PHASE 7A OBJECTIVE

Design a future-proof order lifecycle that:
	•	Fixes current status inconsistencies
	•	Supports manual + semi-automated third-party delivery
	•	Preserves the “no scam” policy
	•	Works with cash-on-delivery delivery fees
	•	Does NOT lock Kiosk into a single courier provider
	•	Keeps Kiosk out of logistics liability

⸻

AUDIT SCOPE (MUST FOLLOW ORDER)

⸻

1️⃣ CURRENT ORDER STATUS AUDIT

Audit and document:
	•	All existing order statuses (exact values)
	•	Where each status is set (buyer, vendor, system, payment webhook)
	•	Which transitions are allowed vs blocked
	•	Which transitions are irreversible
	•	Any ambiguous or overloaded statuses

Explicitly answer:
	•	Does “Payment Received” mean paid OR just authorized?
	•	Is “Shipped” vendor-controlled or system-controlled?
	•	Is “Delivered” verifiable or trust-based?
	•	What happens if delivery fails?

⸻

2️⃣ PAYMENT VS DELIVERY SEPARATION AUDIT

Verify whether:
	•	Payment state and delivery state are conflated
	•	Order can be “paid” but not “delivered”
	•	Order can be “delivered” without confirmation
	•	Refund eligibility is clearly tied to a state

Identify:
	•	Any state where disputes become ambiguous
	•	Any state that allows buyer or vendor abuse

⸻

3️⃣ DELIVERY REALITY CHECK (GHANA CONTEXT)

Audit assumptions against reality:
	•	Delivery handled by Bolt / Uber / Yango / Qargo
	•	Rider is external, not Kiosk employee
	•	Delivery fee paid directly by buyer on receipt
	•	Delivery tracking happens outside Kiosk
	•	Proof of delivery = rider + buyer confirmation, not GPS

Document:
	•	What Kiosk can reliably automate
	•	What must remain manual or declarative
	•	What Kiosk must NEVER be responsible for

⸻

4️⃣ PROPOSED IDEAL ORDER STATUS MODEL (DESIGN ONLY)

Design a clean, explicit status sequence with:
	•	Separate Payment Status
	•	Separate Fulfillment Status
	•	Separate Delivery Status (even if lightweight)

Example (NOT FINAL, just structure):
	•	Order Created
	•	Payment Confirmed
	•	Vendor Preparing
	•	Ready for Pickup
	•	Out for Delivery (external)
	•	Delivered (buyer confirmed)
	•	Completed
	•	Cancelled / Failed

For each status:
	•	Who triggers it
	•	What it means legally
	•	Whether it’s reversible
	•	What it unlocks or locks

⸻

5️⃣ DELIVERY TRIGGER MECHANISM (NO CODE)

Design the semi-automated flow you described:
	•	Vendor clicks “Ready for Pickup”
	•	System prepares delivery payload (addresses, contacts)
	•	Vendor selects courier
	•	System opens courier web/app (deep link or new tab)
	•	Vendor completes booking externally
	•	Kiosk records delivery intent, not tracking

Explicitly state:
	•	What data Kiosk stores
	•	What data Kiosk never stores
	•	What confirms “Delivered” inside Kiosk

⸻

6️⃣ RISK & LIABILITY AUDIT

Identify:
	•	Fraud risks
	•	False delivery claims
	•	Vendor abuse vectors
	•	Buyer abuse vectors
	•	Legal exposure if delivery goes wrong

Propose process-level mitigations only
(NO code, NO tools)

⸻

REQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT (STRICT)

You MUST output ONLY this structure:
