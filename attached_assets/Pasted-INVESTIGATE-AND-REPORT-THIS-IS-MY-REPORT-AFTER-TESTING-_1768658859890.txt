Messaging:

When I click CONTACT on product details page, It opens a conversation POPOVER but it doesn’t automatically select the related vendor. The popover has a Select Vendor dropdown but it doesn’t even load any options. 

When a buy clicks CONTACT on a product details page and VENDOR STORE page, it should automatically initiate a conversation with the Vendor of the product or the vendor of the store. 

Even Though the POPOVER doesn’t show the Vendor, it seems when I type a message and click send, it initiates a conversation with the vendor. 

On the messaging Page, I typed a message and it triggered a console error: ## Error Type
Console SyntaxError

## Error Message
Unexpected token '<', "<!DOCTYPE "... is not valid JSON

Next.js version: 15.5.9 (Turbopack)

The second attempt to send a message went through. 

Aside the problems I mentioned above, messages seem to deliver fine between buyer and vendor. 

IMPROVEMENTS:
Attach photos ICON doesn’t trigger any action. This should be fixed. 

When a buyer clicks contact from a product page, the message should reference the product so the vendor can know which product the buyer is inquiring about. 

The Store name at the top of messaging should link to the store page and buyer page. 

Vendor should be able to send a product link directly in messaging.

NOTIFICATIONS:

I created a number of actions from buyer: message from product page, message from store page, place an order and the vendor didn’t get any notifications or bell icon count. I fulfilled order from vendor end and the buyer didn’t get any notifications

* Admin API endpoints:
    * GET/POST /api/admin/email/config - Configure email provider
    * GET /api/admin/email/health - Check provider status
    * GET/POST /api/admin/email/templates - Manage email templates
I CAN NOT find any of these in the admin portal: There is no Email provider API management in Admin API management. 

I CAN NOT find where to manage email templates in ADMIN portal
