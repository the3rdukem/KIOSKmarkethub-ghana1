✅ PHASE 6 — UX/UI & REBRANDING

STRICT MASTER PROMPT (AUDIT → PROPOSE → APPROVE → IMPLEMENT)

This is refined, disciplined, and enforces control.

⸻

🛑 PHASE 6 — UX/UI & REBRANDING MASTER PROMPT (STRICT)

ROLE

You are acting as a UX/UI Auditor & Design Systems Engineer.

You are NOT allowed to immediately redesign or refactor the app.

Your job is to observe, document, and propose — not to “fix”.

⸻

🚨 GLOBAL RULES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
	1.	❌ DO NOT modify code during the audit phase
	2.	❌ DO NOT change layouts, CSS, or components yet
	3.	❌ DO NOT introduce new UI patterns unapproved
	4.	❌ DO NOT remove features
	5.	❌ DO NOT prioritize mobile at the expense of desktop

If something is bad:
	•	Document it
	•	Explain why
	•	Propose a fix
	•	WAIT for approval

Any implementation without approval = FAILED PHASE.

⸻

🎯 PHASE 6 OBJECTIVE

Prepare KIOSK for real users by fixing:
	•	UX inconsistencies
	•	Layout breakages
	•	Responsiveness issues
	•	Brand inconsistencies (MarketHub → KIOSK)
	•	Mobile & desktop parity

This phase is about usability and trust, not new features.

⸻

🧭 PHASE 6 MUST FOLLOW THESE STAGES

STAGE 1 — UX/UI AUDIT (NO CODE)

Audit existing UI only across:

A. GLOBAL NAVIGATION
	•	Header behavior on mobile vs desktop
	•	Visibility of:
	•	Logo
	•	Search
	•	Cart
	•	Notifications
	•	User menu
	•	Sign in / Sign up
	•	Overflow, clipping, hidden actions

B. HOMEPAGE LAYOUT
	•	Hero section readability on mobile
	•	Search bar usability
	•	Featured products layout
	•	Scroll depth and content density
	•	CTA visibility

C. FOOTER
	•	Link grouping
	•	Vertical vs horizontal layout
	•	Mobile usability
	•	Visual hierarchy

D. BUYER EXPERIENCE
	•	Product cards
	•	Filters
	•	Reviews display
	•	Checkout flow responsiveness

E. VENDOR DASHBOARD
	•	Sidebar / navigation visibility
	•	Text clipping
	•	Table overflow
	•	Action accessibility on mobile
	•	User dropdown visibility

F. ADMIN UI
	•	Consistency with buyer/vendor UI
	•	Mobile survivability (even if desktop-first)

⸻

STAGE 2 — REBRANDING AUDIT (NO IMPLEMENTATION)

Audit:
	•	Remaining MarketHub references
	•	Inconsistent naming (KIOSK vs KIOSK24/7)
	•	Color usage consistency
	•	Typography consistency
	•	Icon style consistency

⸻

STAGE 3 — PROPOSED FIXES (NO CODE)

For each issue, provide:
	•	Problem description
	•	Where it occurs
	•	Why it’s a UX problem
	•	Proposed solution
	•	Scope (small / medium / large)
	•	Affected platforms:
	•	Mobile
	•	Desktop
	•	Both

❗ No fixes yet — proposal only

⸻

STAGE 4 — SCOPED IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

Break work into controlled passes:
	•	Pass 1: Navigation & menus
	•	Pass 2: Homepage layout
	•	Pass 3: Dashboards (buyer/vendor)
	•	Pass 4: Footer & secondary pages
	•	Pass 5: Visual polish (spacing, typography)

Each pass must be:
	•	Isolated
	•	Reviewable
	•	Reversible

Why this prompt is correct now
	•	Respects your phase discipline
	•	Fixes the mobile issues you demonstrated
	•	Prevents agent overreach
	•	Keeps desktop first-class
	•	Forces approval before implementation
	•	Aligns with real Ghanaian usage patterns (mobile-heavy but not mobile-only)
