PHASE 5 — LAUNCH READINESS MASTER PROMPT (STRICT, AUDIT-FIRST)

ROLE

You are acting as a senior marketplace engineer preparing a production launch.

Your task is to complete Phase 5 (Launch Readiness) with zero regressions, no feature creep, and no architectural rewrites.

⸻

❗ CRITICAL RULES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
	1.	AUDIT FIRST — NO CODING UNTIL AUDIT IS COMPLETE
	•	You MUST inspect the codebase and list:
	•	What already exists
	•	What partially exists
	•	What does NOT exist
	•	Present findings BEFORE implementing anything.
	2.	DO NOT MODIFY EXISTING SYSTEMS
	•	No refactors
	•	No schema changes unless explicitly approved
	•	No renaming
	•	No behavior changes to:
	•	Auth
	•	Payments
	•	Messaging
	•	Reviews (already implemented and working)
	3.	NO CMS / PAGE BUILDER
	•	No drag-and-drop
	•	No layouts
	•	No theming engine
	•	No permissions system
	•	No markdown editors beyond basic rich text
	4.	ADMIN-ONLY
	•	All new controls must be accessible only to admin role.
	•	No vendor/buyer access.
	5.	SHIP-READY ONLY
	•	If a feature does not block launch, it is out of scope.

⸻

🎯 PHASE 5 OBJECTIVE

Make the platform operationally launch-ready by giving Admin minimal but sufficient control over:
	•	Branding
	•	Homepage messaging
	•	Legal & informational pages

This phase is about operations, not polish.

⸻

🔍 STEP 1 — REQUIRED AUDIT (MANDATORY)

Before writing code, produce an AUDIT REPORT covering:

A. Existing Admin Controls
	•	Branding (logos, site name, tagline)
	•	Homepage content (hero, banners)
	•	Static pages (about, terms, privacy, contact)
	•	Any existing tables, routes, or UI touching site content

B. Existing Database Structures
	•	Tables that could be reused (e.g. settings, content, pages)
	•	Any generic key/value storage
	•	Rich text or HTML storage (if any)

C. Existing Routes
	•	Admin APIs related to site content
	•	Public routes that already render static content

D. Risks
	•	Anything that might break:
	•	SEO
	•	Routing
	•	Caching
	•	Authentication
	•	Public pages

🚫 STOP after audit. Do not implement until audit is reviewed.

⸻

🧱 STEP 2 — IMPLEMENTATION (ONLY AFTER AUDIT APPROVAL)

Implement ONLY what is missing, using the smallest possible surface area.

1️⃣ Global Site Settings (REQUIRED)

Admin must be able to manage:
	•	Site name
	•	Tagline
	•	Logo (image upload)
	•	Favicon
	•	Default meta description

Rules
	•	Single settings record
	•	No versioning
	•	No history
	•	No multi-tenant logic

⸻

2️⃣ Homepage Content Controls (REQUIRED)

Admin must be able to update:
	•	Hero headline
	•	Hero sub-headline
	•	Hero image
	•	Primary CTA text
	•	Primary CTA link
	•	Promotional banner (text + on/off toggle)

Rules
	•	Structured fields only
	•	No freeform layout editing
	•	No multiple sections

⸻

3️⃣ Static Pages System (REQUIRED)

Admin must be able to create/edit:
	•	About Us
	•	Privacy Policy
	•	Terms & Conditions
	•	Contact Us

Minimum fields
	•	Slug
	•	Title
	•	Rich text body
	•	Published toggle

Rendering
	•	Public route: /pages/[slug]
	•	404 if unpublished

⸻

4️⃣ Informational Pages (OPTIONAL — ONLY IF LOW RISK)

If static pages system supports it without new complexity, allow admin to add:
	•	FAQ
	•	How it works
	•	Safety tips

If this introduces risk, skip it.

⸻

🚫 EXPLICITLY OUT OF SCOPE

You must NOT implement:
	•	Search slider changes
	•	SEO optimization
	•	Page scheduling
	•	Page permissions
	•	Draft previews
	•	Page analytics
	•	A/B testing
	•	Marketing campaigns
	•	Email changes
	•	Notifications
	•	Reviews changes
	•	Messaging changes

⸻

🧪 STEP 3 — EXIT CHECKLIST (MANDATORY)

Before declaring completion, verify:
	•	Admin can update site branding without redeploy
	•	Admin can change homepage copy/images without redeploy
	•	Legal pages render correctly publicly
	•	Unpublished pages are inaccessible
	•	No regression in:
	•	Auth
	•	Payments
	•	Orders
	•	Messaging
	•	Reviews

⸻

🧾 STEP 4 — FINAL EXIT REPORT

Produce a PHASE 5 EXIT REPORT with:
	•	Audit summary
	•	What was reused vs added
	•	Files created (list)
	•	Files modified (list)
	•	Tables added (if any)
	•	Regression check results
	•	Confirmation that platform is launch-ready

⸻

🛑 STOP CONDITIONS

If during audit you discover:
	•	Existing CMS-like behavior
	•	Conflicting content systems
	•	Risk of regression

You must pause and report, not proceed.

⸻

FINAL NOTE

This is not a redesign phase.
This is operational readiness.

Be conservative. Be surgical. Be boring.
