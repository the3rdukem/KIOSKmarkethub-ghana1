🔒 PHASE 4A — EXIT AUDIT MASTER PROMPT (STRICT)

ROLE:
You are acting strictly as an auditor, NOT an implementer.

ABSOLUTE RULES (DO NOT VIOLATE):
	•	❌ Do NOT add features
	•	❌ Do NOT refactor code
	•	❌ Do NOT “improve UX”
	•	❌ Do NOT change schemas
	•	❌ Do NOT touch working flows
	•	❌ Do NOT fix anything unless a failure is confirmed
	•	❌ Do NOT invent requirements

Your job is verification only.

⸻

🎯 PHASE 4A SCOPE (LOCKED)

Phase 4A includes ONLY:
	1.	Search Results Filtering
	2.	Wishlist Persistence
	3.	Buyer ↔ Vendor Messaging (if present in codebase)
	4.	Read-only integrity of previously completed phases (1–3)

Nothing else.

⸻

🧪 REQUIRED AUDIT CHECKLIST

1️⃣ Search Results Filtering

Verify and report ONLY:
	•	Filters return correct results (category, price range, condition, rating)
	•	Multiple filters can be combined without breaking results
	•	Filters do NOT mutate global product state
	•	Clearing filters restores full results
	•	No API errors or silent failures
	•	No client-side filtering of data that should be server-filtered

Report:
	•	✅ PASS / ❌ FAIL
	•	File paths involved
	•	Exact failure scenario if ❌

⸻

2️⃣ Wishlist Persistence

Verify:
	•	Wishlist survives logout/login
	•	Wishlist survives browser refresh
	•	Wishlist is user-scoped (no cross-user leakage)
	•	Wishlist does NOT depend on localStorage only
	•	Removing an item updates state immediately and persistently
	•	Wishlist items reflect correct product availability

Report:
	•	Storage layer used (DB / API / cache)
	•	API endpoints involved
	•	Any edge-case failures

⸻

3️⃣ Messaging (If Present)

If messaging exists in the codebase:

Verify:
	•	Messages are scoped correctly (buyer ↔ vendor only)
	•	No cross-order or cross-user leakage
	•	Messages persist after refresh
	•	Messages cannot be spoofed client-side
	•	Message history loads correctly

If messaging is not implemented, report:

“Messaging not implemented — correctly out of scope for Phase 4A”

⸻

4️⃣ Regression Guard (Critical)

Verify that Phase 4A work has NOT broken:
	•	Checkout flow
	•	Payments (Paystack)
	•	Orders
	•	Product creation/editing
	•	Reviews
	•	Vendor verification
	•	Admin dashboards

Even a single regression must be reported.

⸻

🧾 OUTPUT FORMAT (MANDATORY)

FINAL VERDICT:
	•	✅ PHASE 4A APPROVED
OR
	•	❌ PHASE 4A BLOCKED (with reasons)

⸻

🚨 ENFORCEMENT
	•	If everything passes, say nothing else
	•	If something fails, describe it precisely
	•	Do NOT suggest fixes
	•	Do NOT implement fixes
	•	Do NOT propose future work
